##✨My Experiences
- Android Development:
  - I have experienced developing a mobile application during our Thesis, our app is called [CondiPlant](https://github.com/DJohnJomar/CondiPlant). It is an app that tries to detect root crop diseases by their leaves. I mainly contributed to the design and creation of the mobile application and only a little bit when it comes to the development of the AI we used.
- Web Development:
  - I have created some basic web pages using only HTML, and CSS:
    - [Left 4 Dead 2 Mini Wiki](https://djohnjomar.github.io/Left-4-Dead-2-Mini-Wiki/)
